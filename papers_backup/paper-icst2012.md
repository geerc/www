### Abstract

Database applications are commonly implemented and used in both industry and academia. These complex and rapidly
evolving applications often have frequent changes in the source code of the program and the state and structure of the
database. This paper describes and empirically evaluates a test suite reduction technique that improves the efficiency
of regression testing for database applications by removing redundant tests. The experimental results show that the
reduced test suites are between 30% and 80% smaller than the original test suite, thus enabling a decrease in testing
time ranging from 7% to 78%. These empirical outcomes suggest that test suite reduction is a viable method for
controlling the costs associated with testing rapidly-evolving database applications.

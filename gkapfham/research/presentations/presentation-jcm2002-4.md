### Abstract

The combination of Jini network technology and the JavaSpaces service provides an exceptional environment for the design
and implementation of loosely-coupled distributed systems. In this presentation, we will explore the strengths and
weaknesses of Outrigger, a current implementation of a persistent JavaSpaces service. Furthermore, we will present
RDBSpace, a JavaSpaces service that is supported by a relational database. Our experimental results indicate that it is
possible to build an efficient and scalable JavaSpaces service that relies on a relational database back-end. Moreover,
the mature relational database technology employed by RDBSpace can easily enable the introduction of data replication
and backup facilities into the JavaSpaces object repository. While the current implementation of RDBSpace does not
attain the performance benchmarks that have been set by Sun's implementation of a persistent JavaSpace, we believe that
RDBSpace provides an exciting, free, and open source JavaSpaces service that warrants further implementation efforts.

### Abstract

Today, software developers do not rely soley on custom built software systems to construct large scale information
systems. The system being built and maintained are made up of a combination of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
components, legacy software, and custom built components. Corporate down-sizing and decrease government budgets, as well
as the spiraling costs of building and maintaining large software systems, have made the development of a system
completely from original components and impossibility. A result of this transition has been that developers are relying
on the usage of commercial-off-the-shelf components with increased frequency.

### Abstract

Although a software application always executes within a particular environment, current testing methods have largely
ignored these environmental factors. Many applications execute in an environment that contains a database. In this
paper, we propose a family of test adequacy criteria that can be used to assess the quality of test suites for
database-driven applications. Our test adequacy criteria use dataflow information that is associated with the entities
in a relational database. Furthermore, we develop a unique representation of a database-driven application that
facilitates the enumeration of database interaction associations. These associations can reflect an application's
definition and use of database entities at multiple levels of granularity. The usage of a tool to calculate
intraprocedural database interaction associations for two case study applications indicates that our adequacy criteria
can be computed with an acceptable time and space overhead.

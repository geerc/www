### Abstract

From the perspective of the software testing practitioner, regression testing is often an important technique for
developing high quality software systems. The software testing research community has developed several different
approaches in order to ensure that regression testing process is cost-effective and practical. The techniques developed
by Harrold, Rothermel, Rosenblum, Weyuker, Soffa and others have attempted to increase the cost-effectiveness of
regression testing by intelligently selecting a subset of an entire regression test suite for execution. Recent
approaches created by Elbaum, Malishevsky, Rothermel, Untch, Chu, and Harrold have tried to improve a regression test
suite's rate of fault detection by prioritizing the execution of the tests. In this paper, we describe the conceptual
foundation, design, and implementation of an approach that distributes the execution of regression test suites. We show
that our technique can complement existing regression test selection and prioritization approaches. We also demonstrate
that it can be used independently when existing approaches are not likely to increase regression testing efficiency.
Finally, we describe the design and implementation of Joshua, an application that facilitates the distributed execution
of regression test suites for Java-based software systems.

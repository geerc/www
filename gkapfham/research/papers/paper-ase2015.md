### Abstract

Due to the exponential increase in the number of mobile devices being used to access the World Wide Web, it is crucial
that web sites are functional and user-friendly across a wide range of web-enabled devices.  This necessity has resulted
in the introduction of responsive web design (RWD), which uses complex cascading style sheets (CSS) to fluidly modify a
web site's appearance depending on the viewport width of the device in use. Although existing tools may support the
testing of responsive web sites, they are time consuming and error-prone to use because they require manual screenshot
inspection at specified viewport widths. Addressing these concerns, this paper presents a method that can automatically
detect potential layout faults in responsively designed web sites. To experimentally evaluate this approach, we
implemented it as a tool, called ReDeCheck, and applied it to 5 real-world web sites that vary in both their approach to
responsive design and their complexity. The experiments reveal that ReDeCheck finds 91% of the inserted layout faults.

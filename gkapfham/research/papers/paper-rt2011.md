### Abstract

The published studies of regression testing methods often contain many of the hallmarks of high quality empirical
research. Beyond features like clear descriptions of the methodology and the visualization and statistical analysis of
the data sets, certain papers in this field also provide some of the artifacts used in and/or produced by the
experiments. Yet, the limited industrial adoption of regression testing techniques is due in part to a lack of
comprehensive empirical evaluations. Moreover, the regression testing community has not achieved a level of experimental
reproducibility that would fully establish it as a science. After identifying the challenges associated with evaluating
regression testing methods, this paper advocates a way forward involving a mutually beneficial increased sharing of the
inputs, outputs, and procedures used in experiments.

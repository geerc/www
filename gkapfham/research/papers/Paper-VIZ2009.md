### Abstract

Software testing increases confidence in the correctness of an application's source code. Altering a test suite's
execution order enables earlier detection of defects and allows developers to fix errors sooner. The many existing
prioritization methods produce different possible test suite orders from which to choose. We propose, implement in a
free and open source system, and informally evaluate Interactive Coverage Effectiveness Multiplots, an interactive
visualization technique that allows software testers to quickly filter, appraise and compare the effectiveness of many
test suite orders. Preliminary results show that researchers, students, and practitioners in the field of software
testing find the system useful.

### Abstract

Test suite reduction techniques decrease the cost of software testing by removing the redundant test cases from the test
suite while still producing a reduced set of tests that yields the same level of code coverage as the original suite.
Most of the existing approaches to reduction aim to decrease the size of the test suite. Yet, the difference in the
execution cost of the tests is often significant and it may be costly to use a test suite consisting of a few
long-running test cases. Thus, this paper proposes an algorithm, based on the concept of test irreplaceability, which
creates a reduced test suite with a decreased execution cost. Leveraging widely used benchmark programs, the empirical
study shows that, in comparison to existing techniques, the presented algorithm is the most effective at reducing the
cost of running a test suite.

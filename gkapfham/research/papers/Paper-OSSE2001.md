### Abstract

As open source software engineering becomes more prevalent, employing sound software engineering practices and the tools
used to implement these practices becomes more important. This paper examines the current status of free software
engineering tools. For each set of tools, we determined the important attributes that would best assist a developer in
each stage of the waterfall model. We rated each tool based on predetermined attributes. We used the creation of a
graphical user interface based email client in Java to assist in evaluating each tool. Our findings show that there is
still a need for free tools to extract UML diagrams, test graphical user interfaces, make configuring Emacs easier, and
profile Java applications. In other areas there are free tools that provide satisfactory functionality such as
Concurrent Versions System (CVS), GVim, JUnit, JRefactory, GNU Make, Jakarta Ant, Javadoc, and Doc++.

### Abstract

The combination of the Jini network technology and the JavaSpaces object repository provides an exceptional environment
for the design and implementation of loosely coupled distributed systems. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of the
most popular implementation of a persistent JavaSpace. We report on the design, implementation, and analysis of
RDBSpace, a JavaSpace that is supported by a relational database. Our experimental results indicate that it is
possible to build an efficient and scalable JavaSpace that relies on a relational database back-end.

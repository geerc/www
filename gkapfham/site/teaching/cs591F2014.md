### Course Catalog Description

A study of the concepts, principles, and skills needed to successfully describe, design, implement, test, deploy, use,
and document mobile applications. Investigated in the context of Android-based mobile applications running on the Google
Nexus 7, topics include conditional logic, iteration, modularity, parameter passing, user interaction, graphical user
interfaces, and network communication. Students practice the principles of mobile application development by
participating as members of groups tasked with the creation of mobile applications. One required class session per week.
No background in computer science is required. Credit: Two semester hours for a group study. Prerequisites: Permission
of the instructor.

Dr. Gregory M. Kapfhammer is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College. Dr.
Kapfhammer earned his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Kapfhammer's PhD
dissertation research was supervised by Dr. Mary Lou Soffa. Kapfhammer also earned a BSc in Computer Science from
Allegheny College and a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh. Kapfhammer has held positions as a
visiting research scientist in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia and as a research
associate at Cigital Research Labs. 

As an educator, Dr. Kapfhammer develops and teaches courses in the areas of software engineering, software testing, data
management, and distributed systems. He is also involved in the teaching of the department's introductory courses,
junior seminar, senior seminar, and a research adviser for undergraduate theses. Kapfhammer's expertise in teaching was
recently recognized when Allegheny College presented him with the Thoburn Award for Excellence in Teaching. As an
experimental computer scientist, Dr. Kapfhammer conducts research in the areas of software engineering, software testing
and analysis, and computer software systems. In collaboration with a diverse and highly skilled group of students and
colleagues, Kapfhammer pursues research that results in award-winning and frequently-cited Research Papers and useful
Free and Open Source Software.

The paper A Family of Test Adequacy Criteria for Database-Driven Applications, co-authored by Kapfhammer and Dr. Mary
Lou Soffa, was selected to receive the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the 2003 ACM SIGSOFT Foundations of
Software Engineering Conference (ESEC/FSE 2003). Kapfhammer's paper Empirically Studying the Role of Selection Operators
During Search-Based Test Suite Prioritization, co-authored with Alexander P. Conrad and Dr. Robert S. Roos, was also
recognized as the best paper in the Search-Based Software Engineering Track of the 2010 ACM SIGEVO Genetic and
Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2010). Kapfhammer frequently serves the research community as a reviewer for
conferences and journals, technical program committee member, conference program co-chair, workshop co-chair, and review
panelist at the U.S. National Science Foundation.

Dr. Kapfhammer's endeavors are guided by the following professional principles:


<b>Principle 1 (Selfless Service)</b> Focus on the needs of your students and colleagues before considering your own. Commit to
respectfully serving others even when your actions are unlikely to be noticed, rewarded, or beneficial to your own
professional development.

<b>Principle 2 (Absolute Excellence)</b> Devote yourself and encourage others to commit themselves to uncompromising excellence
in all aspects of personal and professional development.

<b>Principle 3 (Realistic Expectations)</b> Recognize that all people, including yourself, have strengths and weaknesses.
Identify the strengths in your own life and the lives of others and plan activities so as to maximize the positive
impact on the community.

**Principle 4 (Contagious Joy)** Pursue everything with passion and enthusiasm. Take advantage of every opportunity to
encourage your students and colleagues. Always end a conversation or a meeting with a positive remark.

[Gregory M. Kapfhammer]({{site.baseurl}}) is an Associate Professor in and Chair of the [Department of Computer
Science](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu) at [Allegheny College](http://www.allegheny.edu). Dr. Kapfhammer earned his PhD
from the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.pitt.edu) at the [University of
Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu); his PhD dissertation research was supervised by [Dr. Mary Lou
Soffa](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/). Kapfhammer also earned a BSc in Computer Science from Allegheny College and
a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh. Kapfhammer has held positions as a visiting research
scientist in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.virginia.edu) at the [University of
Virginia](http://www.viginia.edu), the [Institute of Applied Information
Processing](http://iai.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/en/index.html) at [University of Ulm](http://www.uni-ulm.de/en), and the
[Department of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at the [University of
Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). In the past, Gregory Kapfhammer was a research associate at
[Cigital](http://www.cigital.com/). 

As an educator, Gregory Kapfhammer develops and teaches [courses]({{site.baseurl}}teaching) in the areas of
software engineering, software testing, data management, mobile app development, operating systems, and distributed
systems. He is also involved in the teaching of the department's introductory courses, junior seminar, senior seminar,
and a research adviser for undergraduate theses.  Kapfhammer's expertise in teaching was recently recognized when
Allegheny College presented him with the [Thoburn Award for Excellence in
Teaching](http://sites.allegheny.edu/alumni/involved/allegheny-awards/recipients/#thoburn). As an experimental computer
scientist, Gregory Kapfhammer conducts [research]({{site.baseurl}}research/) in the areas of software
engineering, software testing and analysis, and computer software systems. In collaboration with a diverse and
highly-skilled group of students and colleagues, Kapfhammer pursues research that results in award-winning and
frequently cited research [papers]({{site.baseurl}}research/papers/), oft-complimented
[presentations]({{site.baseurl}}research/presentations/), and useful free and open-source
[software]({{site.baseurl}}software/).

The paper "[A Family of Test Adequacy Criteria for Database-Driven
Applications]({{site.baseurl}}research/papers/paper-fse2003/)", co-authored by Kapfhammer and [Dr. Mary Lou
Soffa](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/), was selected to receive the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the
[2003 ACM SIGSOFT Foundations of Software Engineering Conference (ESEC/FSE 2003)](http://esecfse.cs.helsinki.fi/).
Gregory Kapfhammer's paper "[Empirically Studying the Role of Selection Operators During Search-Based Test Suite
Prioritization]({{site.baseurl}}research/papers/paper-gecco2010/)", co-authored with Alexander P. Conrad and [Dr. Robert
S. Roos](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/~rroos/), was also recognized as the best paper in the [Search-Based Software
Engineering Track](http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2010/organizers-tracks.html#sbse) of the [2010 ACM SIGEVO Genetic and
Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2010)](http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2010/). Moreover, he frequently serves the
research community as a reviewer for conferences and journals, technical program committee member, conference program
co-chair, workshop co-chair, workshop program co-chair, and review panelist at the U.S. National Science Foundation.

As an outworking of his Christian faith, Gregory Kapfhammer's endeavors are guided by the following professional principles:

<b>Principle 1 (Selfless Service)</b>: Focus on the needs of your students and colleagues before considering your own. Commit to
respectfully serving others even when your actions are unlikely to be noticed, rewarded, or beneficial to your own
professional development.

<b>Principle 2 (Absolute Excellence)</b>: Devote yourself and encourage others to commit themselves to uncompromising excellence
in all aspects of personal and professional development.

**Principle 3 (Relentless Effort)**: Unless the opportunity cost of further effort is prohibitively high, work hard
towards the accomplishment of the goals you setâ€”and help others to do the same.

**Principle 4 (Realistic Expectations)**: Recognize that all people, including yourself, have fundamental strengths and
weaknesses.  Identify the strengths in your own life and the lives of others and plan activities so as to maximize the
positive impact on the community.

**Principle 5 (Contagious Joy)**: Pursue everything with passion and enthusiasm. Take advantage of every opportunity to
encourage your students and colleagues. Always end a conversation or a meeting with a positive remark.

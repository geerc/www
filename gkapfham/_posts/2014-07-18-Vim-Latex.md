If you are like me, then you may enjoy writing in a notebook with a fountain pen&mdash;if you have not tried writing
this way, then borrow someone's fountain pen and start writing! As much as I may enjoy writing with a fountain pen, I
still spend a substantial amount of time writing technical papers in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) in the
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor&mdash;a task I also really enjoy.

{% highlight vim linenos %}
" Configure vim-latex so that it enables the SyncTeX feature and does 
" not perform folding (I don't like it!) and TOC resizing (seems buggy!) 
let g:latex_latexmk_options="-pdf -pdflatex='pdflatex -file-line-error -synctex=1'"
let g:latex_fold_enabled = 0
let g:latex_quickfix_open_on_warning = 0
let g:latex_toc_resize = 0
let g:latex_toc_hide_help = 1
{% endhighlight %}

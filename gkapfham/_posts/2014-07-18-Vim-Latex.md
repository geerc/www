If you are like me, then you may enjoy writing in a notebook with a fountain pen&mdash;if you have not tried writing
this way, then borrow someone's fountain pen and try it! As much as I may like writing with a fountain pen, I still
spend a substantial amount of time preparing technical papers and presnetations in
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) with the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor&mdash;a task I also find to be
challenging and rewarding.

If you write with Vim and LaTeX and you would like to improve your writing experience, then please consider using the
[vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) plugin as it supports wonderful features like the completion of BibTeX
references, continuous compilation with [latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/), and forward
and reverse searching for [MuPDF](http://mupdf.com/) PDF viewer. Are you interested in learning more about how I
configured these plugins? Please study the source code of my `.vimrc` that is available in the GitHub repository
[gkapfham/dotfiles](https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles).

Yet, it is possible to use these tools to create nicely formatted and correct papers. As an example of a paper, please
consider reading {% cite McMinn2016a %}, the source code of which is also available in a GitHub repository at
[gkapfham/ast2016-paper](https://github.com/gkapfham/ast2016-paper). An example of a presentation that I prepated in LaTeX is {%
cite Kapfhammer2015 %}, which you can study from its GitHub repository at
[gkapfham/seke2015-presentation](https://github.com/gkapfham/seke2015-presentation). There's something else that is
really nice about programming your papers and presentations in LaTeX&mdash;you can release their source code on GitHub
to share with others an "instruction manual" that explains, in a step-by-step fashion, exactly how 
to produce a document just line yours!

If you are like me, then you may enjoy writing in a notebook with a fountain pen&mdash;if you have not tried writing
this way, then borrow someone's fountain pen and try it! As much as I may like writing with a fountain pen, I
still spend a substantial amount of time writing technical papers in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) with the
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor&mdash;a task I also find to be challenging and rewarding. 

If you would like to improve your LaTeX writing experience, then please consider using the
[vim-latex](https://github.com/lervag/vim-latex) and [Tex-9](https://github.com/vim-scripts/TeX-9/) plugins.  The first
plugin supports nice features like the completion of BibTeX references and continuous compilation with
[latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/), while the second furnishes a forward and reverse
searching feature for [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince).  Here are some sample lines from my
<code>.vimrc</code> file showing how I configured these two plugins.

{% highlight vim linenos %}
" Configure vim-latex so that it enables the SyncTeX feature and does 
" not perform folding (I don't like it!) and TOC resizing (seems buggy!)
let g:latex_latexmk_options="-pdf -pdflatex='pdflatex -file-line-error -synctex=1'"
let g:latex_fold_enabled = 0
let g:latex_quickfix_open_on_warning = 0
let g:latex_toc_resize = 0
let g:latex_toc_hide_help = 1
" Configure Tex-9 so that it enables forward and reverse searching
let g:tex_nine_config = {
            \'compiler': "latexmk",
            \'synctex': 1
            \}
{% endhighlight %}

If you are like me, then you may enjoy writing in a notebook with a fountain pen&mdash;if you have not tried writing
this way, then borrow someone's fountain pen and try it! As much as I may like writing with a fountain pen, I
still spend a substantial amount of time writing technical papers in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) with the
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) text editor&mdash;a task I also find to be challenging and rewarding.

If you write with Vim and LaTeX and you would like to improve your writing experience, then please consider using the
[vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) plugin as it supports wonderful features like the completion of BibTeX
references, continuous compilation with [latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/), and forward
and reverse searching for [MuPDF](http://mupdf.com/) PDF viewer. Are you interested in learning more about how I
configured these plugins? Please study the source code of my `.vimrc` that is available in the GitHub repository
[gkapfham/dotfiles](https://github.com/gkapfham/dotfiles).

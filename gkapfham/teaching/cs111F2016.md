realization of algorithms using a modern object-oriented programming language. Topics include algorithms, problem
solving, programming, classes, primitive data types and objects, control structures, arrays and vectors, principles of
object-oriented design and programming, and an introduction to graphics and graphical user interfaces. The course also
includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and a study of the social implications of computer use. May
serve as the laboratory course in the Natural Science Divisionâ€™s distribution requirement. One laboratory per week.
Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary algebra.

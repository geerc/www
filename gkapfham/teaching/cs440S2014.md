### Course Catalog Description

A study of operating systems and their design and implementation. Topics include the evolution of modern computer
operating systems, basic components of an operating system, and hardware issues of importance to operating system design
and implementation. Consideration is given to processes and threads, resource (processor, memory, device, and software)
management, process and device scheduling, deadlocks, input/output, file systems, and system security. A representative
operating system is examined in detail. One laboratory per week. Prerequisite: Computer Science 210. Offered in
alternate years.

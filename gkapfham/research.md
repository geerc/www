As an experimental computer scientist, the goal of my research is to design, implement, and evaluate techniques and
software tools that support the creation of useful, dependable, and efficient software applications. My research
addresses the challenges within the fields of software engineering, software testing and analysis, and computer systems.
I conduct this research in collaboration with undergraduate students at [Allegheny College](http://www.allegheny.edu),
graduate students and professors at other colleges and universities, and colleagues in industry.

My research is empirical in nature because it involves the application of the scientific method to formulate problem
statements, carry out experiments, take observations, statistically analyze and visualize the data sets, and draw
conclusions based upon the experimental results. Each research project focuses on the development and testing of
software artifacts that can be used in both empirical studies and real-world practice by undergraduate and graduate
students, software engineers, and computer scientists in both academia and industry. My research also results in
award-winning and frequently cited research [papers]({{site.baseurl}}research/papers/), oft-complimented
[presentations]({{site.baseurl}}research/presentations/), and useful free and open-source
[software]({{site.baseurl}}software/).
